# NBA-Web-Scrapper

Started working on web scrapper to scrap data from https://www.basketball-reference.com for an initiative, meanwhile found another github repo -
https://github.com/vishaalagartha/basketball_reference_scraper, which has done similar kind of work. Used their repo and created new functions as per our project needs.
