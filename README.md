# NBA-Web-Scrapper

Started working on web scrapper and developed - https://github.com/KapilJ22/NBA-Web-Scrapper/blob/master/Scrapper.py to scrap data from https://www.basketball-reference.com for an initiative, meanwhile found another github repo -
https://github.com/vishaalagartha/basketball_reference_scraper, which has done similar kind of work. 
Used their repo and created new functions as per our project needs. The new functions are inside: `team_players.py`.

## Development
1. `pip install basketball-reference-scraper`.
2. Play with functions inside `team_players.py`.
